QUESTIONS:
1 - What columns violate 1NF?
2 - What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?
3 - Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.

ANSWERS:
1 - colums "food_code" and "food_description" - have the same problem. They have differebt data separated by comas
2 - Members - Club members
    Dinners - Dinners (events)
    Venues - Venues
    Foods - Foods

Of cource for the real entities extraction we need more tables and info. HoweverHowever, for me personally, this is a tricky question, 
because in my experience (outside of programming), we can manipulate data and play with definitions. So, theoretically.
I'd classify the member address in the task as a property rather than an entity (based solely on the column names). 
However, this isn't explicitly stated, so I can assume that an address is also an entity, just in a different context.

3 - table: Members
    columns: Member_id, Member_name, Member_address

tables: Venues
columns: Venue_code, Venue_description,

tables: Foods
columns: Food_code, Food_description

tables: Dinners
columns: Dinner_id, Dinner_date, venue_code

tables: dinner_attendees 
columns: Dinner_id, member_id

tables: dinner_foods
columns: Dinner_id, food_code
